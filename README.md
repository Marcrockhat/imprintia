# imprintia

Imprintia is a pipeline designed to discover imprinted genes from DNA-seq and RNA-seq data.
It featured felxibility in determining imprinting threshold and are designed to be compatible for diploid or other species with different ploidy level.

It requires parental DNA-seq data and offspring RNA-seq data for imprinting detection.
